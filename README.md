# New OSX Setup
Setup a new OSX with my favourite settings and applications.

# Installation
1. Git clone this repository somewhere on your machine
2. Go to this directory and run ```./osx-setup-command.sh```
3. Answer a couple questions and wait for everything to download! 


# Post Installation Instructions
